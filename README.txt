The Public 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey Results

Description:

The enclosed data set is the full, cleaned results of the 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. Free response submissions and personally identifying information have been removed from the results to protect the privacy of respondents. There are three files besides this README:

1. survey_results_public.csv - CSV file with main survey results, one respondent per row and one column per answer
2. survey_results_schema.csv - CSV file with survey schema, i.e., the questions that correspond to each column name
3. so_survey_2020.pdf - PDF file of survey instrument

The survey was fielded from February 5 to February 28, 2020. The median time spent on the survey for qualified responses was 16.6 minutes.



As an incentive, respondents who finished the survey could opt in to a "Census" badge if they completed the survey.
